Repel-Simulation
================

This was a simple simulation I performed using python in order to find how points arrange themselves when repelling forces are present.

The work from here itself was presented in my undergraduate thesis available at: http://librarydb.saintpeters.edu:8080/bitstream/123456789/206/1/Niraula%2C%20Prajwol%20thesis.pdf
